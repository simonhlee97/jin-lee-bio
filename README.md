# Relative Age Effect

I used websites like [baseball-reference.com](https://baseball-reference.com), [basketball-reference.com](https://basketball-reference.com), etc. to find the date of birth for professional sports teams.

I first learned about "relative age effect" back in 2009 in Malcolm Gladwell's book, *Outliers*.

This is a small project built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a python documentation tool. **MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation.**

I use a MkDocs plugin called MkDocs-Charts, which uses [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. **Vega-Lite provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation.**

Deployed to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
