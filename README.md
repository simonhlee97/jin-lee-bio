# Sports and Relative Age Effect

This is a small project built with [MkDOcs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a python documentation tool. **MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation.**

I use a MkDocs plugin called MkDocs-Charts, which uses [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. **Vega-Lite provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation.**
