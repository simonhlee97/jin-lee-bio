# About this project

I'm a big fan of Malcolm Gladwell's *"Outliers"*. He recently did a podcast titled "Outliers, Revisited" where he discussed **relative age effect** with students at UPenn. I looked up some professional baseball and basketball teams and made some charts to see how the rosters were distributed across birth-months, to see if the distribution was similar to the 40-30-20-10 phenomenon Gladwell discussed with Canadian psychologist [Roger Barnsley](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Ex-lR0YAAAAJ&hl=en) (the OG of "relative age effect" research).
