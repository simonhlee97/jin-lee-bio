# About this project

I'm a big fan of Malcolm Gladwell's *"Outliers"*. He recently did a podcast titled "Outliers, Revisited," where he did a small experiment and discussed **relative age effect** with students at UPenn. I looked at rosters of NCAA basketball, soccer, and basketball teams, but date of birth wasn't available, so I'm using some professional baseball, football, and basketball teams instead. The plots for the rosters were distributed across quarters based on birth-month, to see if the distribution was similar to the 40-30-20-10 phenomenon Gladwell discussed with Canadian psychologist [Roger Barnsley](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Ex-lR0YAAAAJ&hl=en) (the OG of "relative age effect" research).
